The files in this repo are meant as examples only, you may not
use or copy any of the code in this repo for school assignments.

In the jGrasp samples, we will walk through a nice array, a buggy
array, a linked list, and multiple errors we will show you how
to debug.

In the GDB samples, we will make use of common GDB shortcuts and
demonstrate how to use the GDB user interface.

Welcome to the debugging workshop!
